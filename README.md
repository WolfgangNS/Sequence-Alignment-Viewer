## Motivation

I am currently an undergraduate research volunteer in a lab that studies East African Cichlids brains. We have data, but I was not yet granted access. To my surprise, I found several projects on NCBI GEO that had publicly available datasets on Cichlid brains already. I knew that whatever code I used to analyze that public data would extend to our lab's private data, as well.  

I was searching all around the web for a notebook that simply runs IGV, with no luck. By sheer force (and lots of trial and error), I found all of the packages, data resources, and workflow that would consolidate the steps into a single notebook, rather than having many confusing files and folders. I'm hoping this will save some other researchers/enthusiasts some headaches. 

## Features

- **Download SRA Data**: Access raw genetic sequencing data from NCBI's Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

- **Genome Alignment**: Align SRA data to a reference genome, providing insights into gene locations and variations.

- **IGV Visualization**: Utilize the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) to visualize sequencing data directly in your browser.

## Research Significance

- Analyze gene expression patterns.

- Investigate non-coding genome regions.

## Ideas for further exploration

- Identify genetic variations (mutations, SNPs).

- Compare genomes across species or strains.
